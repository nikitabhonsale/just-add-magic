                <p>Just Add Magic is a family-friendly fantasy television series 
                    based on the book by Cindy Callaghan. The show follows three middle school 
                    friends—Kelly, Darbie, and Hannah—who discover an old magical cookbook in Kelly's 
                    attic. As they begin to try out its recipes, they realize each dish has a magical 
                    effect, often leading to mysterious or unintended consequences.</p>
