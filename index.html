    <p>as a teenager whose streaming platforms were all set to kid-friendly, Just Add Magic was 
        one of my favourite shows. it had just enough wondorous worldbuilding for me to actually 
        enjoy the idea of cooking. also, i happened to watch it at the same time as some of my best 
        friends. we fell in LOVE with that show.
    </p>
    <p>so much so, in fact, that we made our own little cookbook inspired by the show. we would 
        diligently meet up every weekend, search up a new recipe, make up some fancy sounding spice names 
        and cook- and, of course, update the precious cookbook. it became a ritual, in fact.
    </p>
    <p>going home after a year of college, i stumbled upon that cookbook- and it brought on a terrific
        wave of nostalgia. that was also when this task got assigned to me. as someone that doesnt like
        to sit and choose things very much, i decided my submission would be about what was on my mind 
        the most at that point. 
    </p>
    <p>if you've watched the show too, take a trip down nostalgia lane with me. if you haven't watched 
        the show, enjoy lore about a show you'll probably never watch. but you should. it's awesome.
